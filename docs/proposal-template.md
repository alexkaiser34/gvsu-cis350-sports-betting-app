# Introduction

<p>
The purpose of our project is to create a web application to display real sports betting odds for NFL (national football league) games. The user will be able to login and create an account with an email, username, and password. The user will be able to interact with the application in a browser to track and monitor their own bets.

# Anticipated Technologies

- Microsoft Visual Studio
- The odds API
- AWS
- ASP.NET core MVC

# Method/Approach
Since the web application will have a front-end, back-end, and API, we are planning to assign some team members to work on each component in parallel.  Alex Kaiser will also act as project manager and help assign tasks to each person.
