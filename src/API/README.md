# Web API Sports Betting
This project will create a RESTful API to communicate with the frontend.  This API
will handle the communication with the database (dynamoDB)

## Configuring AWS Credentials
To add you AWS credentials, add your secret and access key to `src/API/appsettings.json`.
This will give the app premissions to access the dynamoDB.
